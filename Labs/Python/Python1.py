# Level 1: Getting familiar with Python syntax

# Exercise 1: Print "Hello, World!"
# This program prints the classic "Hello, World!" message to the console.
print("Hello, World!")

# This program takes two numbers as input from the user,
# converts them to integers, and then prints their sum.

# Exercise 3: Calculate the area of a circle
# This program takes the radius of a circle as input,
# calculates its area using the formula A = Ï€ * r^2, and prints the result.

# An odd number has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.

# Exercise 5: Swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable
# This program demonstrates two common ways to swap variables in Python:
# 1. Using arithmetic operations (for numbers)
# 2. Using tuple unpacking (the most Pythonic way, works for any data type)

# Method 1: Using arithmetic operations (only works for numbers)
print("--- Swapping using arithmetic operations ---")
a = 5
b = 10
print(f"Before swap (arithmetic): a = {a}, b = {b}")
a = a + b  # a becomes 15 (5 + 10)
b = a - b  # b becomes 5 (15 - 10)
a = a - b  # a becomes 10 (15 - 5)
print(f"After swap (arithmetic): a = {a}, b = {b}")

print("\n--- Swapping using tuple unpacking (Pythonic way) ---")
x = "Hello"
y = "World"
print(f"Before swap (unpacking): x = '{x}', y = '{y}'")
x, y = y, x # This is equivalent to: temp = x; x = y; y = temp
print(f"After swap (unpacking): x = '{x}', y = '{y}'")
